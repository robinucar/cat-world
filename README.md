# cat-world

### Context
    1) Sign up and create an API key at
    https://thecatapi.com/

    2) Create an app that retrieves some data from one
    of the cat API endpoints (of your choice) and
    renders it on a web page. (Be creative!) You can
    use language/framework that you are most
    comfortable with.

## Improvements

### Testing
I can write unit tests for the app using JEST and React testing library.

### Styling 
I can use some css framework such as Bootstrap, Material UI to improve client side.

### Server Side 
I can refactor server js file. Route logic can go route file, controller logic (reqeuest, response wrap and send) can stay in controller file , and an ApiService class that can do API calls to the thecats API.

I can add user authentication. 

I can also make POST, PUT, DELETE requests to the thecats API. These requests give me the chance to upload cat images and details, and also will be able to edit and upload data.



### Client Side
I can also filter data by character, dog friendliness, child friendliness etc,
I can implement pagination.
